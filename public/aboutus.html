        <h6>Michael recommended our Lapland holiday for us last year and we had the most magical trip. He was so helpful and always replied quickly to 
          any queries we had. We always use Travel Experts for all our trips. We like knowing we are using people that we have met in person to help

              <p>My love for travel and adventure began at an early age, and eventually brought me into the Travel Industry.  
                With over 20 years of actively selling travel in and around the US, I have had the opportunity to visit many 
                amazing destinations such as Iceland, Guam, Ecuador, Scotland, Ireland and the Caribbean.</p>
              <p>​In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, surfing, great food, & listening to music!</p>

              <p>Thirty years ago I decided staying home was boring! I headed off to school to start a career I love.
                 From Australia, China, Cape Horn, Jamaica, Babados and Galapagos, where we were privileged to watch the live birth of the Sea Lion…
                 to Europe and across the USA, I knew that I want to share this experience with the world.</p>
              <p>Being a Travel Consultant and sharing the experiences of my customers introduced me to cultures (and foods) one might only read about!</p>

              <p>Trips I took with my Dad at a very young age developed the passion in me today. Now I do what I love and love what I do. 
                ​ In addition to Ireland and Scotland, my travels include England, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, France, Spain, 
                 The Netherlands and the Caribbean, including a recent culinary tour of Cuba.</p>
              <p>My passion began from the very first trip to my homeland as a promise to my Dad. Now its part of me.</p>
